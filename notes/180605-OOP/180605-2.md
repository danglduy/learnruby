1. Abstraction # Truu tuong
- Object => Class # Abstract/describe an object with its properties and behaviors
2. Encapsulation # Dong goi
- By default, attributes cannot be modified directly but only by methods. (private by default)
- Some methods cannot be accessed externally (private methods). 
```Ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :counter, :fuel # Create get and set method for attrs
  def drive(l)
    counter = l
    fuel_change(2)
  end

  # define private method
  private
  def fuel_change(v)
    fuel = v
  end
  
end
# In Ruby, all attributes are private by default
car1 = Car.new
car1.drive(5000)
#car1.fuel_change(2) # Error: private method

```
3. Inheritance # Ke thua
- Class methods are inherited from parents.
```Ruby
class Vios < Car
  attr_accessor :wheel
  def initialize
    @wheel   = 4 # Instance's/Object's variable
    @utility = ""
    @@seat   = 5 # Class's variable
  end
  
  def setUtility(v)
    @utility = v
  end
  
  def getUtility
    @utility
  end
  
  def self.seat
    @@seat
  end
  
  def self.seat=(s)
    @@seat = s
  end
  
end

class Vios2_0 < Vios

end

v1 = Vios2_0.new
v1.wheel = 4
```
- Override
```Ruby
class Vios3_0 < Vios
  def drive(l)
    super # Call parent drive() method
    puts "GPS"
  end
  
end

v2 = Vios3_0.new
v2.drive(500)
puts v2.wheel
puts v2.getUtility
v3 = Vios3_0.new
v3.setUtility("GPS1")
puts v3.getUtility
puts Vios3_0.seat
```
4. Polymorphism # Da hinh
- By override: Methods with same name different results because of method override, different object => polymorphism
