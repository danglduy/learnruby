1. Methods
- Defined by "def"
- Do not care if it returns
- Last result will be returned

2. Blocks, Procs & Lambdas
- Procs, Lambdas closures?
- To group codes
- Blocks are not objects
- Procs are like containers of blocks. Lambdas are like methods.

3. Blocks
- Between {} or do end
```Ruby
def square (a)
  a.each do |x|
    yield x * x
  end
end
square([1, 2, 3]){|x| puts x}
```
- Cannot pass > 1 blocks as arguments
4. Procs
```Ruby
def square (a, &b)
  a.each do |x|
    b.call x * x
  end
end
square([1, 2, 3]){|x| puts x}
```
- Wrap block -> object
```
{puts "abc"}.call # Error
Proc.new{puts "abc"}.call # "abc"
```
- Can pass > 1 procs as arguments
```Ruby
def square (a, p1, p2)
  a.each do |x|
    p1.call x * x
    p2.call x * x * x
  end
end
proc = Proc.new{|x| puts x}
square([1, 2, 3], proc, proc)
```
5. Lambda
- Anonymous function, global function
```Ruby
# succ = lambda {|x| x + 1}
# succ = ->(x){x + 1}
succ.call # 3

lam = ->x{puts x*2}
[1, 2, 3].each(&lam)

f=->(x,y;i,j,k){...} # 2 arguments & 3 local vars

```
6. Procs vs Lambdas
- Both are Proc objects
- Slight different while returning objects
- Must have arguments
- Must have fewer than 3 arguments
```Ruby
lam =

```
- "return" inside lambda doesn't trigger "return" outside of the lambda block.
7. Closure
- Use variables out of their scope

8. Exception handling
```Ruby
begin
rescue
ensure
end
```
